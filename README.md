# mac_secure

This was a project under Electronics Club, IITK for its door. This is a program for the smart lock. When the user connects to lock's hotspot the door is unlocked. The mac-address of the user is
used for encryption. Only the user whose mac address matches can open the lock.  


This program is using bash for checking mac-address and python for unlocking the door. We used Rpi for hotspot and controller, custom built controlled magnetic lock.
